The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database that contains information on terrorist attacks worldwide from 1970 to 2021. The database has 21 rows and 10,518 columns and covers 221 countries. The data includes the total number of terrorist attacks, terrorist deaths, and the number of attacks by different methods such as hijacking, hostage-taking, unarmed assault, facility/infrastructure attack, kidnapping, assassination, armed assault, and bombing/explosion.

The GTD provides a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics, causes, and consequences of terrorism around the world. It allows users to analyze patterns such as the frequency of terrorist attacks, geo-spatial patterns of terrorist attacks, the lethality of terrorist attacks, patterns of casualties including injured persons and hostages, the emergence and prevalence of particular tactics and targeting strategies used in terrorist attacks, and the evolution of perpetrators of terrorist attacks
